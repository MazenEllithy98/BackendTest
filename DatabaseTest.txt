#Database
# Given table 
# Employee -> {id, salary}; id is the primary key
# Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report NULL.

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary
    FROM Employee
    WHERE salary < (
        SELECT MAX(salary)

    )
) AS second_highest_salaries

# if there is no second highest salary the subquery will return null and the main query will also return null
